Hello, thanks for playing Super Dungeon Adventure!
Your goal as the player to make it as far as you can in the dungeon,
slaying enemies and getting as high a score as possible.

The game is a top down dungeon exploration game, but theres a 
few quirks to the gameplay you should know before you dive in.

Move around using the WASD keys, hit enemies with SPACE, use
a healing potion to heal 1/3 of your max health and pause the
game with Q (also used to see some extra stats).

You will always attack directly in front of you, which is determined
by the last direction you moved. Also, the game is turn based, meaning no
enemy will move until after the player does. Enemies will attack you if they're
close enough, so don't be afraid to go on the offensive.

Enemies will become stronger the farther you make it into the dungeon, but don't
worry, because the player will grow in strength each time they level up from killing
enemies. You can check your current exp level and exp to level in the pause
menu.

Well, that should be it, for now. Enjoy!
