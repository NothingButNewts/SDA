Hello, thanks for playing Super Dungeon Adventure!
Your goal is to explore the floors by slaying enemies and
progressing by finding the ladder on each floor.

The game is a top down dungeon exploration game, but theres a 
few quirks to the gameplay you should know before you dive in.

Move around using the WASD keys, hit enemies with SPACE and interact 
with objects using ENTER.

You will always attack directly in front of you, which is determined
by the last direction you moved. Also, the game is turn based, meaning no
enemy will move until after the player does. Enemies will attack you if they're
close enough, so don't be afraid to go on the offensive.

Well, that should be it, for now. Enjoy!
