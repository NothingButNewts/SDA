2/22/16 9:48 PM: Start code and classes created

2/23/16 2:03 AM: Added variables to Player and Enemy classes

2/23/16 3:30 PM: Reuploaded the files, hopefully it works correctly this time.

2/23/16 4:23 PM: Added basic values to player variables, Loaded in a temporary grid to test movement, and loaded a temporary player texture

2/24/16 3:28 AM: Loading texture for the player is now done in Player.cs, set up basic framework for Level() method in Player.cs

2/24/16 11:21 PM: Player movement is in the game, also created a basic turn based system to test. Just threw a Sleep thread in to simulate an enemies turn to see if it works.
Reorganized loading of textures with the introduction of a Sprite class, loaded in a test enemy texture.

3/8/16 8:19 PM: Loads one map into the game, and draws that map to the screen(currently only draws the walls and blank spaces).
Player and the enemy texture were resized to fit with the size put for the map tiles sizes. Character correctly moves within
the level area. Collision is not in the game yet, and there is no combat or enemy AI yet. A first playable is possible at this point, 
with the rendering of the character/world and movement. Will continue to be improved for a better first playable however.

4/7/16 12:22 PM: Collision! We have a basic version of collision in the game, the player doesn't gon inside the walls of the game world anymore.

4/24/16 1:31 PM: Enemy movement is now in the game for Ghouls, as well as spawning ghouls based on loaded map. Player collision '
and enemy collision with one another is the next step.
